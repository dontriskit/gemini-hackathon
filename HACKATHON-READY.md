## üé¨ 3-Minute Demo Script

### Opening (30 sec)
"SEED helps hackathon participants make meaningful connections.

**The Problem**: With 400+ people here, finding the RIGHT people to talk to is overwhelming. You might miss amazing opportunities.

**SEED's Solution**: Use AI to match you with relevant people based on deep context, practice the conversation, then meet up with specific location suggestions."

### Demo Flow (2 min)

**Part 1: Onboarding (30 sec)**
```
[Show landing page]
"First, SEED learns about you through a quick conversation"

[Click "Start Finding Connections"]
[Answer 2-3 questions quickly]

"Notice the beautiful markdown formatting and how the agent asks follow-up questions based on your answers"

[Click "Continue to Search"]
```

**Part 2: Search with Vectara (45 sec)**
```
[Search page auto-loads]

"SEED automatically searches through 424 hackathon participants using Vectara - a RAG system that understands semantic meaning, not just keywords"

[Profile cards appear]

"Look at these matches - each one includes:
- Full context from LinkedIn
- Company intelligence data
- AI-generated reasoning for WHY they're a good match

This isn't keyword matching - it's semantic understanding of who can actually help you."

[Click "Simulate Conversation"]
```

**Part 3: Simulator with Maps (45 sec)**
```
[Simulator page loads]

"Before you actually approach them, practice the conversation"

[Have quick exchange]
"The agent role-plays as them using their real profile"

[Type: "where should we meet?"]

"And here's the magic - when you're ready to meet, SEED uses Google Maps Grounding to suggest actual nearby locations"

[Maps suggestions appear with 20 places]

"These are REAL places from Google Maps - Delah Coffee, Caffe Trieste, etc. - with direct links to get directions"
```

### Closing (30 sec)
"Built with:
- **Google Gemini Flash Lite & 2.5 Flash** - All AI agents + Maps grounding
- **Vectara RAG** - Semantic search over 424 profiles with full context
- **Mastra.ai** - Agent orchestration with memory
