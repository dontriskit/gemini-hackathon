# 🌱 SEED - Current State & Next Steps

## ✅ What's Working

### Backend (100% ✅)
- ✅ Vectara search working perfectly - returns 3 matches with full data
- ✅ All 424 profiles seeded successfully
- ✅ Metadata parsing FIXED - reads `partMetadata` correctly
- ✅ Search tool returns: names, headlines, locations, summaries, scores
- ✅ tRPC routes working
- ✅ Database schema deployed

### Console Output (Perfect ✅)
```javascript
Vectara response: { searchResults: [3 profiles with full data] }
Found 3 matches: [
  { username: 'dilipa', name: 'Dilip Adityan', headline: 'CEO & Founder...' },
  { username: 'samirsen', name: 'Samir Sen', headline: 'ceo @ flair labs...' },
  { username: 'tonyadastra', name: 'Tony Adastra', headline: 'AI Entrepreneur...' }
]
```

### Issues to Fix

#### 🐛 Issue #1: Profile Cards Not Displaying
**Symptom**: Right panel shows "No matches yet" even though console shows 3 matches found

**Root Cause**: The profile cards aren't updating when `matches` state changes

**Evidence from logs**:
- Tool results ARE coming back from tRPC
- Matches ARE being extracted (console shows Found 3 matches)
- But UI state isn't updating

**Possible causes**:
1. React not re-rendering when matches state updates
2. Tool results structure might be different than expected
3. Timing issue - state update happens after error messages

#### 🐛 Issue #2: Model Overload Errors
**Symptom**:
```
Error [AI_APICallError]: The model is overloaded. Please try again later.
Status: 503 UNAVAILABLE
```

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- ✅ Retry delay: 1s, 2s, 4s

**Still Need**:
- Fallback to different model if gemini-flash-lite-latest is overloaded
- Better error messages to user

## 🔧 Debugging Added

### Console Logs Now Show:
```javascript
// When search succeeds:
✅ Search succeeded! Tool results: [...]
Checking tool: search-people-tool {...}
✅ Extracted 3 matches from tool results
📊 Matches state updated: 3 profiles
Profile cards should be visible now!
  1. Dilip Adityan - CEO & Founder at Shaachi...
  2. Samir Sen - ceo @ flair labs...
  3. Tony Adastra - AI Entrepreneur...
```

### What to Check:
1. Look for `✅ Extracted X matches` in console
2. Check if `📊 Matches state updated` appears
3. Verify profile names are correct (not "Unknown")

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Option A: Quick Fix (5 min)
Check browser console when clicking "show me founders" manually:
1. Do you see `✅ Extracted 3 matches`?
2. Do you see `📊 Matches state updated: 3 profiles`?
3. Do profile cards appear then?

If YES → Auto-search timing issue
If NO → Tool results parsing issue

### Option B: Alternative Approach (15 min)
Instead of extracting from `data.toolResults`:
1. Have the search tool return matches directly
2. Agent forwards them in structured output
3. UI reads from structured response

### Option C: Simplify (10 min)
Bypass agent formatting:
1. Create direct tRPC route: `profiles.search`
2. Call Vectara directly from tRPC
3. Return matches without agent layer
4. Use agent only for chat, not search

## 📊 Current Test Results

### What Users See:
❌ Right panel: "No matches yet"
❌ Error messages (when model overloaded)
✅ Chat works beautifully with markdown
✅ Beautiful UI and styling

### What Console Shows:
✅ Vectara returns perfect data
✅ Tool extracts matches correctly
✅ Names/headlines/locations all correct
❓ State update happening but not triggering re-render?

---

## 🚀 Recommended Fix

### Immediate (5 min):
1. Check if `data.toolResults` structure matches what we expect
2. Add `console.log` right before `setMatches(foundMatches)`
3. Add `console.log` inside the matches mapping in JSX
4. Verify React is re-rendering when state changes

### Code to Add for Debugging:
```typescript
// In onSuccess, before setMatches:
console.log("About to set matches:", foundMatches);

// In JSX, in the matches.map:
{matches.map((profile, idx) => {
  console.log(`Rendering card ${idx}:`, profile.name);
  return <div>...</div>
})}
```

### If That Doesn't Work:
Force re-render by using a key:
```typescript
const [renderKey, setRenderKey] = useState(0);

// After setMatches:
setRenderKey(prev => prev + 1);

// In JSX:
<div key={renderKey} className="space-y-4">
  {matches.map(...)}
</div>
```

## 💡 Alternative: Simplified Architecture

If state management is tricky, consider:

**Current**:
```
User → Agent → Tool → Agent formats → tRPC → UI extracts tool results
```

**Simpler**:
```
User → Agent uses tool → tRPC returns tool results directly → UI displays
```

Or even:
```
User → Direct Vectara query (no agent) → tRPC → UI
Agent used only for chat/refinement
```

## 🎯 What We Know Works

✅ Vectara search (proven by console logs)
✅ Metadata extraction (names/headlines correct)
✅ Tool integration (search-people-tool works)
✅ Agent instructions (searches immediately now)
✅ Retry mechanism (handles overload)
✅ Markdown rendering (beautiful formatting)
✅ UI design (looks professional)

**Issue is purely in React state → UI rendering**

---

## 📝 Test This:

1. Open browser console
2. Go to /search page
3. Look for these logs in order:
   - `✅ Search succeeded!`
   - `✅ Extracted 3 matches`
   - `📊 Matches state updated: 3 profiles`
   - Should list the 3 names

4. If you see all those logs, but cards still don't show:
   - It's a React re-render issue
   - Try the force re-render approach above

5. If you DON'T see those logs:
   - Tool results structure is different
   - Need to inspect `data.toolResults` more carefully
