# 🗺️ Google Maps Integration Complete!

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. Real Google Maps Grounding
**Maps Tool** (`src/mastra/tools/maps-tool.ts`):
- ✅ Uses `@google/gnai` package
- ✅ Model: `gemini-2.5-flash` (supports Maps grounding)
- ✅ Enable widget: `{ googleMaps: { enableWidget: true } }`
- ✅ SHACK15 coordinates configured
- ✅ Returns interactive widget token + place data

### 2. Interactive Maps Widget Component
**Component** (`src/components/maps-widget.tsx`):
- ✅ Renders `<gmp-place-contextual>` with widget token
- ✅ Fallback to place links if no token
- ✅ Professional card design with header
- ✅ Shows "📍 Suggested Meeting Locations"

### 3. Simulator Integration
**Simulator page** (`src/app/simulate/[username]/page.tsx`):
- ✅ Loads Google Maps JS API
- ✅ Extracts Maps tool results
- ✅ Displays widget in conversation flow
- ✅ Updates when Maps tool is called

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Complete Prerequisites
Ensure you have in `.env`:
```bash
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="your-key"
# Optional: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY for widget (uses same key for now)
```

### Step 2: Trigger Maps Tool in Conversation
Go to simulator and have this conversation:

```
You: "Let's grab coffee and discuss this further"

Agent: [Calls mapsTool with placeType: "coffee shop"]
Agent: "Great! I found some spots near SHACK15..."

[Maps widget appears below conversation! 🗺️]
```

### Step 3: Check Server Console
Look for these logs:
```bash
🗺️ Maps tool called with: { placeType: "coffee shop", walkingDistance: 15 }
🗺️ Searching for coffee shop within 15 min of SHACK15...
🗺️ Full response: {...}
🗺️ Grounding metadata: {
  "groundingChunks": [...],
  "googleMapsWidgetContextToken": "widgetcontent/..."
}
🗺️ Extracted 3 suggestions from Maps grounding
🗺️ Widget token: ✅ Present
🔧 Tool: mapsTool
📍 Result: {
  "success": true,
  "suggestions": [
    { "name": "Sightglass Coffee", "uri": "...", "placeId": "..." }
  ],
  "widgetToken": "widgetcontent/..."
}
```

## 🎯 Demo Talking Points

### Why This Is Amazing:
1. **Real-time data** - Not static suggestions, actual Google Maps results
2. **Interactive widget** - Users can click, explore, get directions
3. **Context-aware** - Based on SHACK15 location
4. **Up-to-date** - Hours, ratings, reviews from Google Maps
5. **Actionable** - Direct links to navigate there

### Technical Excellence:
- ✅ Using official Google Maps Grounding API
- ✅ Proper widget token handling
- ✅ Fallback if grounding fails
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Professional UI integration

### Unique to SEED:
**Only hackathon project that:**
- Uses Google Maps grounding for networking
- Embeds interactive widgets in conversation
- Provides actionable meetup suggestions
- Combines AI agents + Maps + RAG search

## 📝 How to Trigger Maps Tool

The agent will call Maps tool when conversation includes:
- "Where should we meet?"
- "Any good coffee shops nearby?"
- "Find a restaurant"
- "Suggest a location"
- "Let's grab coffee"
- "What's open now near SHACK15?"

Or you can explicitly ask:
```
You: "Use the Maps tool to find coffee shops"
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Widget Doesn't Appear:
1. Check server console for widget token
2. Verify Google Maps JS API loaded
3. Check browser console for component errors
4. Ensure Maps tool actually called (check logs)

### If Tool Not Called:
1. Verify `maxSteps: 5` in simulator route ✓
2. Check agent has `tools: { mapsTool }` ✓
3. Agent instructions mention using Maps tool ✓
4. User message triggers location intent

### If Grounding Fails:
- Fallback suggestions still show
- Agent can still suggest static locations
- Check API key is valid
- Verify model supports grounding (gemini-2.5-flash ✓)

```
You: "This sounds great! Where should we meet at the hackathon?"

Agent: [Calls mapsTool]
Agent: "Perfect! I found some places..."

[🗺️ Interactive Google Maps widget appears!]
[Shows real coffee shops with ratings, hours, links]
```

**Check server console for:**
```bash
🗺️ Widget token: ✅ Present
📍 Result: { widgetToken: "widgetcontent/...", suggestions: [...] }
```

**Check browser for:**
```javascript
🗺️ Maps tool result received: { widgetToken: "...", suggestions: [...] }
```
