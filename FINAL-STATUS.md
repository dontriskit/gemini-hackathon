## üîç How Search Works

1. **User describes criteria** ‚Üí "find me founders"
2. **Search Agent** transforms to query ‚Üí "founders CEO startup entrepreneur"
3. **searchPeopleTool** queries Vectara corpus
4. **Vectara** semantic search over:
   - 424 profiles
   - Full text: name, headline, bio, company TLDR, expertise tags
   - Metadata: location, industry, email, etc.
5. **Returns top 3 matches** with relevance scores
6. **Agent formats results** as markdown with reasoning
7. **UI displays** profile cards + chat

## üêõ Debugging

### Check Browser Console:
```javascript
// Vectara search responses
Vectara response: { searchResults: [...], summary: "..." }

// Parsed matches
Found 3 matches: [{username: "...", name: "...", ...}]
```

### Check Server Logs:
```bash
# Agent tool calls
[INFO] Agent: searchAgent
[INFO] Tool: search-people-tool
[INFO] Query: "founders CEO startup"
```

### Common Issues:

**Matches not appearing?**
- Check browser console for `Found X matches`
- Verify Vectara API key in `.env`
- Check network tab for tRPC responses

**Agent not using tool?**
- Agent needs user to ASK for search
- Try explicit: "find me X" or "search for Y"
- Check maxSteps is set (currently 3)

**Rate limit errors?**
- gemini-flash-lite-latest has generous limits
- Script uses 2-second delays (30 RPM)
- Free tier: 60 RPM

## üöÄ Demo Script

### Opening (30 sec)
"Hi! I'm showing SEED - an AI-powered relationship platform for hackathon participants.

The problem: With 400+ people here, how do you find the RIGHT connections?

SEED uses Google Gemini and RAG to match you with people based on deep context - not just job titles."

### Demo Flow (2-3 min)

**Stage 1: Onboarding**
[Click "Start Finding Connections"]
"The agent asks conversational questions to understand who I am and who I'm looking for."
[Answer 2-3 questions quickly]
"Notice the markdown formatting - lists, bold text, all rendered beautifully."

**Stage 2: Search**
[Type: "find me founders working on AI products"]
"Now it's searching through 424 hackathon profiles using Vectara - a RAG system that understands semantic meaning, not just keywords."
[Wait for results]
"Look at these matches - each one includes AI-generated reasoning about WHY they're a good fit, based on their LinkedIn AND company intelligence data."

**Stage 3: Simulator**
[Click "Simulate Conversation"]
"Before you actually approach them, you can practice the conversation. The agent role-plays as them using their actual profile context."
[Have a quick exchange]
"This helps you prepare icebreakers and discover synergies before the real meeting."

### Closing (15 sec)
"Built with Google Gemini Flash Lite, Mastra.ai for agent orchestration, and Vectara for semantic search. All 424 participants are searchable with full context extraction."

**Total time**: ~3 minutes
