## 🗺️ NEW: Google Maps Integration!

### How It Works

During networking simulation, when conversation reaches meeting planning:

**User**: "Great! Let's meet up at the hackathon"
**Agent**: [Calls mapsTool with placeType: "coffee shop"]
**Agent**: "Perfect! How about Sightglass Coffee on 7th St? It's a 5-minute walk from SHACK15."

### Technical Implementation

**Uses**:
- `@google/genai` package
- Google Maps grounding API
- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model
- SHACK15 coordinates (lat/lng)

**Returns**:
- Real nearby places from Google Maps
- Walking distance
- Google Maps links
- Fallback to curated suggestions if API fails

**Tool Configuration**:
```typescript
tools: [{ googleMaps: {} }],
toolConfig: {
  googleMapsRetrieval: {
    latLng: { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 }
  }
}
```
