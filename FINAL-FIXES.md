# 🎉 SEED - Final Fixes Complete!

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### Issue A: Onboarding Context Now Shows Real Data ✓

**Before**: Placeholder text
**After**: Real values extracted from conversation

**How it works:**
1. During onboarding, when agent says "Got it! I have everything..."
2. Client extracts user responses from message history
3. Stores in localStorage as JSON: `{ name, location, priority, lookingFor, funActivities }`
4. Search page loads and displays in collapsible section

**To see it:**
- Click "📋 Show search criteria from onboarding"
- See your actual name, location, priorities, etc.

### Issue B: No More Duplicate Messages ✓

**Before**: Agent listed all 3 profiles in chat + cards showed them = duplicate

**After**: Agent just says "Found 3 great matches! Check the cards →"

**Updated Search Agent instructions:**
```
DON'T list the profiles (the UI shows cards).
Just say: "Found X matches! Check out the profile cards on the right →"
Keep it SHORT.
```

**Result**: Clean chat, detailed info in cards (no duplication)

---

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### Profile Cards Now Have:
- ✅ Avatar images (or colored initials fallback)
- ✅ Name & headline with better spacing
- ✅ Location with 📍 icon
- ✅ AI summary
- ✅ Match reasoning in muted box
- ✅ Match number badge (#1, #2, #3)
- ✅ "Simulate Conversation" button

### Avatars Work With:
- Real photos from Cerebral Valley (if available)
- UI-avatars.com fallback (name → colored avatar)
- Initials in colored circle (if avatar fails)

**Note**: Current seed doesn't have avatars yet. To add them:
```bash
pnpm reset:vectara
pnpm seed:vectara  # Includes avatars now
```

---

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

**Layout adapts:**
- **< 768px (mobile)**: Vertical stack (chat above, results below)
- **≥ 768px (desktop)**: Side-by-side 50/50 split

**Tailwind classes:**
```tsx
flex-col md:flex-row        // Direction
w-full md:w-1/2             // Width
border-b md:border-b-0      // Borders
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Tool Name Mismatch
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
toolName === "search-people-tool"  ❌

// After (CORRECT):
toolName === "searchPeopleTool"  ✅
```

### 2. Metadata Field
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
const metadata = result.documentMetadata  ❌ // Always {}

// After (CORRECT):
const metadata = result.partMetadata  ✅  // Has data!
```

### 3. tRPC Serialization
```typescript
// Server extracts before returning:
const serializableToolResults = response.toolResults?.map(tr => ({
  toolName: tr.payload?.toolName,
  result: tr.payload?.result
}));
```

### 4. Client Extraction
```typescript
// Client reads from simplified structure:
const toolName = toolResult.toolName;  // No more .payload!
const result = toolResult.result;
```
