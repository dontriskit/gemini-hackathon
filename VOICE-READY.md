### Step 4: Continue Q&A
Agent asks 5 questions:

3. Biggest priority
4. Who you're looking for
5. What you do for fun

Speak naturally - it's a conversation!

### Step 5: Auto-Redirect

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Audio Flow
```
Browser Mic (16kHz PCM16)
    ↓ POST chunks
Server (/api/voice/onboard)
    ↓ agent.voice.send(audioData)
Gemini Live API
    ↓ WebSocket
Gemini processes & responds
    ↓ voice.on('speaking', ...)
Server receives audio (24kHz PCM16)
    ↓ SSE stream
Browser plays audio
```

### Event Handling
**Server listens for:**
- `writing` → Transcript (sent via SSE)
- `speaking` → Audio data (sent via SSE)
- `turnComplete` → Conversation turn done
- `error` → Handle gracefully

**Client listens for:**
- `transcript` → Update UI
- `audio` → Play agent voice
- `ready` → Start recording
- `error` → Show alert

### Audio Format Conversion
**Browser → Server:**
- Capture: Float32 from MediaStream
- Convert: Int16 (PCM16)
- Send: Binary ArrayBuffer

**Server → Browser:**
- Receive: Int16Array from Gemini
- Encode: Base64 in SSE
- Decode: Uint8Array → Int16Array
- Play: Convert to AudioBuffer → play
