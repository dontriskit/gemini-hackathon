# üé§ Gemini Live Voice - Setup Instructions

## Quick Fix for Current Error

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable
Add this line to your `.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="${GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY}"
```

Or set both explicitly:
```bash
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="AIzaSyD06yQ7njgWIa0AbOVCut3bIlFsSEdEtuk"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSyD06yQ7njgWIa0AbOVCut3bIlFsSEdEtuk"
```

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Ctrl+C to stop
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Test Voice
```
http://localhost:3000/onboard-voice
Click üé§ button
```

**Expected**: Connection should succeed and you'll hear the agent speak!

## If Still Having Issues

The Mastra wrapper might not be sending the voice config correctly. Here's what we've configured:

```typescript
voice: new GeminiLiveVoice({
  apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY,
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025",
  speaker: "Puck",
  debug: true,
  realtimeConfig: {
    // Voice configuration for native audio
    options: {
      sessionConfig: {
        generationConfig: {
          responseModalities: ["AUDIO", "TEXT"],
          speechConfig: {
            voiceConfig: {
              prebuiltVoiceConfig: {
                voiceName: "Puck"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```
