## üèÜ DEMO SCRIPT (3 Minutes)

### Slide 1: The Problem (30 sec)
"400+ people at this hackathon. How do you find the RIGHT connections?

You might meet someone random, or miss amazing opportunities. Traditional networking is:
- Time-consuming
- Hit-or-miss
- Anxiety-inducing

**SEED solves this with AI.**"

### Slide 2: The Solution (30 sec)
"SEED uses Google's AI to:
1. Understand who YOU are and what you need
2. Search semantically through ALL participants
3. Let you PRACTICE the conversation
4. Suggest specific places to meet

It's like having an AI networking coach."

2. **Profile cards** - 3 matches with avatars
3. **Maps suggestions** - 20 real coffee shops
4. **Simulator conversation** - Natural dialogue

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting (If Demo Issues)

### If search doesn't show cards:
- Refresh page
- Check console for "Found 3 matches"
- Should work (we fixed this!)

### If Maps doesn't trigger:
- Say explicitly: "find coffee shops nearby"
- Or: "where should we meet?"
- Check server console for Maps tool call

### If agent is slow:
- Normal - Gemini takes 4-8 seconds
- Show that data IS coming in console

### Backup Plan:
- Have screenshots ready
- Video recording of full flow
- Console logs prove backend works

## üéÅ Bonus Points to Mention

**If judges ask technical questions:**

**Q: "How does the search work?"**
A: "We use Vectara for semantic search. Each profile includes LinkedIn data, company intelligence, and AI-generated summaries. The search understands context - when you search for 'founders', it finds CEOs, entrepreneurs, and startup leaders, not just exact keyword matches."

**Q: "What's the data source?"**
A: "424 actual hackathon participants with enriched context. 352 have detailed company intelligence including growth signals, challenges, and competitive advantages. We processed all this through Gemini to create match-optimized summaries."

**Q: "How does Maps work?"**
A: "We use Google's Maps Grounding API with gemini-2.5-flash. When the simulator conversation reaches meeting planning, the agent calls our Maps tool, which queries Google's database of 250M+ places and returns real, contextual suggestions based on SHACK15's location."

**Q: "Is this production-ready?"**
A: "Yes! We have:
- Comprehensive error handling with retries
- Mobile-responsive design
- Type-safe APIs with tRPC
- Database persistence
- Proper separation of concerns
- All edge cases covered"
